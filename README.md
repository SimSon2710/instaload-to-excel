# InstaPostsToExcel

This small application is a stand-alone extension for [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/). Its 
task is to merge *.json.xz files (metadata of instagram posts), images and comments generated by Instaloader into a *.xlsx file. This makes it easier to view the post texts in context with the images.




## Features

- extract meta data from Instaloader \*.json.xz files
- extract comments from Instaloader \*.json.xz files
- bind posts, images, and comments together

## Prerequisites

1. To use the tool, make sure you installed all the modules from the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and potential dependencies.
2. The tool only works with files downloaded via Instaloader.
3. Only metadata files with \*.json.xz extension and images with \*.jpg extension are supported.
4. Make sure your folder structure fit the structure below.
4. The tool is only tested in Windows environment. If you are lucky, running it in other environments, let me know :) 

### File and folder structure

The tool works with a single folder containing the data as well as with a folder with multiple folders containing the data. The corresponding *.xz.json files and the *.jpg files have to be in the same folder.

#### Example structure 1
- folder
    - sub-folder
        - *.json.xz
        - *.jpg
    - sub-folder
        - ...

#### Example structure 2
- folder
 - *.json.xz
 - *.jpg
 - ...
## Common Usage
1. Start the [main.py](main.py)
2. Define the path of the directory where the files or folders with files are located
3. Define the name and the path of the \*.xlsx file the tool generates
## Deployment

If you want to share the tool with people who cannot use Python, it is possible to convert the tool into an *.exe file using e.g. [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller). Last time, however, it did not work with the `--one-file` option, but only unpacked as a folder.
